# How to start the project?
First, download the projetct to your computer. After that, open it in a java IDE (I used Intellij Idea). 
The project will not be fully loaded and ready for execution due to the presence of an additional library, namely JavaFx 13. It can be downloaded from the following link:
https://gluonhq.com/download/javafx-13-sdk-windows (if you click on the link, JavaFx 13 will be downloaded automatically).
When JavaFX 13 is available, go to IDE settings and add it. If you use Intellij Idea: File -> Project Structure -> Global Libraries (add a path to the JavaFx) -> Modules -> 
Dependencies -> + Library -> Apply -> OK. Now start the project and you will see a window where you can choose only text files. When the file is choosen, the program 
will find the two employees who have worked the longest on a joint project.
